If you allow design to lead in parallel with the data itself then the results of your development project will be better.  Critical to this belief is the fundamental principle that design is not decoration, rather, design is problem solving. Technical designers are faced with how to best communicate the information being conveyed by your data.  This is why technical design is hard, and also why it's so often misunderstood.

It's not enough to simply have data and make a pretty chart.  To make an effective chart that's intuitive and able to tell a story to an audience of fifteen executives in 30 seconds - that's difficult.  In my professional experience, this is one of the greatest challenge facing enterprise organizations today, and it all boils down to communication.  Done poorly, and the attention of that audience is lost, or, possibly worse, they've come up with their own conclusion from the data without clarifying it front of their colleagues.  This happens all the time.  I've done it.

If the problem can be recognized, it can be solved.  This might be more difficult than the recognition step, though.  Why?  Engineers and analysts make charts, interpret data, and build models.  Designers tell stories and build experiences.  Both are needed, yet rarely are the two skills in the same room.  Best case scenario?  Your engineers _are_ your designers, and vice versa.  If not, then they should at least be paired within their teams.  Or, `more generally`, an engineering team needs a sister designer team.  Not a design team in Boston and an Engineering team in Seattle.  Co-located.  They need to talk, understand each other's perspectives, and learn to think together.

Your designers need to be the ones asking questions.  They are on the front lines when it comes to requirements development and translating business requirements into actionable development tasks.  The designers aren't the requirements definition layer, though.  They take verbal requirements, use case descriptions, user stories, and they draft up screen mockups, and
