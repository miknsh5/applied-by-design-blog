We started Applied by Design to help improve the aviation industry.

Collectively we've worked in aviation for 18 years designing new aircraft programs, flight testing, marketing aircraft and services, consulting to airlines, and developing mission critical applications and tools.  On July 1st, 2013, we left these careers and started Applied by Design.  

We've seen the OEM side of the aviation industry inside and out, and this only encouraged our pursuit of an opportunity.  We've been a part of failed aircraft programs, seen development projects turn into chaos, and witnessed an abundance of complacency and mediocrity in an industry in need of just the opposite.  We started this company out of a desire to raise the standards for the products and services available to airlines.  These products and services help airlines operate more efficiently, make better business decisions, and provide better experiences to the end users - you and I, passengers.  We started Applied by Design to change an industry dominated by legacy systems, risk aversion, and a lack of leadership.  

Where are the airlines re-imagining what it means to fly?  Where are the innovators?  Airlines are in the operator role, Boeing and Airbus are in the aircraft manufacturing role, and without each other neither would exist.  But that shouldn't mean that the experience of flying be dominated by a manufacturer who's incentives are misaligned with those of the end users (passengers).  Applied by design thinks its time to focus on building products for the airlines that help solve problems for passengers.  Airlines are preoccupied with minimizing fuel costs and meeting on-time performance metrics.  This is good, except they've lost sight of what it takes to deliver a truly great experience to the air traveler.  

Yes, we care about being on time, being comfortable, and not paying $1200 to fly from Seattle to Denver.  But that doesn't mean that as passengers we don't also value the collective 'little things' that can take an experience from being good to great, or even phenomenal.  

We're not suggesting that airlines necessarily change the way they do business.  We are, however, suggesting that there are vast opportunities for airlines to do business smarter, more efficiently, and in a way that looks out for not just the bottom line, but for the customer.  We've witnessed the results of development projects rooted in nothing but 'cool technology' that ultimately serves little to no actual customer need.  

We can't stop companies from making bad decisions, but we can start one that's free from the cultural and bureaucratic hurdles that make innovation and courage so difficult to rekindle.  The aviation industry is in need of airlines daring to raise the status quo and take a chance at being not just good, but great.  To do so, airlines need to start by rethinking what it means to connect and engage with their customers.  It demands an attention to detail, to progressive design thinking, and an unwavering focus on every aspect of the user experience.  The first truly great airline won't emerge because they opened a new route, took delivery of a new 787, achieved record breaking on-time performance, or began serving complimentary filet mignon to coach.  The first great airline will dare to reinvent the experience of flying all together, starting with the passenger.  We have some great ideas regarding what this means, and we plan to share them here.  

We're actively looking for the visionary airlines looking to make a bold statement.  Drop us a line if you'd like to hear more.
