Strategy and development occur sequentially, while design is pervasive to virtually every aspect of the project. By design, we're referring more specifically to problem solving.  It encompasses UI and screen mockups, data design, analytical models, and an overall focus on finding the most efficient way to communicate information.  Extreme prototyping encourages our use of static application mockups and design comps, while evolutionary prototyping influences our technology framework decisions early on.  This helps ensure that we're able to leverage the effort put into prototypes, not simply throw them away and start from scratch.  


Lastly, taking a Test Driven Development approach to application development helps further advance the pace of application development by reducing debugging tasks and encouraging a more modularized codebase.  Our preferred development framework, AngularJS, also strongly encourages TDD with well supported out of the box testing tools that drastically simplify the learning curve. 


As we work through our next application project, we're planning to dive into greater details for each piece of the development methodology.  We're constantly evolving with changes in technology and with the industry itself, and as we mature we'll be sharing what we learn along the way.
